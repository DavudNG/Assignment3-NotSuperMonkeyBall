    Spikes.cs
    Author: Angus
    Desc: This script is attached to the spikes on the level.
        This script essentially allows the player to get damaged when touching a spike
        Spikes have a unique hitbox that is a trigger, so we can use OnTriggerEnter2D and OnTriggerExit2D
    Issue: As the spikes hitboxes are triggers, this code is constantly run while the player is in the hitbox
        Unfortunately, this means that if the player enters the hitbox at a lower point they may get damaged multiple times
        before leaving the hitbox. To alleviate this, a cooldown has been applied to this script so that the 
        player can only get damaged once every 0.5 seconds while touching the spikes.
        This now means that if tthe ball touches the spikes slighly before the player does, the spikes will lag
        and the player will not be damaged until re-entering the hitbox.
